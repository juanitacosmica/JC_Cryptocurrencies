# JC_Cryptocurrencies
Module 18: Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

# Overview of the analysis:

For this project, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, this analysis is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how the bank could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The raw data was not ideal, so it was required to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the bank is looking for, we use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we use a clustering algorithm. We use data visualizations to share the findings with the board.

- D1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- D2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- D3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- D4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
